When new inventory is created in CRFREporter (in fall) some manual work is needed before all is set.
1. Natural disturbances
Item: P.B Article 3.4 Activities -> KP.B.1 Forest Management -> Carbon stock change -> 
Emissions and removals from natural disturbances -> Total natural disturbances
Each year new element ("a new leaf in a tree") must be created manually. 
The UID identifier or each item of the element must be retrieved from CRFReporter Simple.xml.
Tips: write nonsense values (for easy recover) for 1990 only, export simple xml and find the nonsense
values. This guides close to the UIDs.

2. HWP Activity data
The years starting from 1961 miss the current inventory year. It is not automatically added.
The current inventory year must be manually inserted.
