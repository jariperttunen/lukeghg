Manual work after each new inventory in CRFReporter.
=====================================

Natural disturbances
-----------------
`P.B Article 3.4 Activities -> KP.B.1 Forest Management -> Carbon stock change -> 
Emissions and removals from natural disturbances -> Total natural disturbances`

Each year new element must be created manually. 
The UID identifier or each item of the element must be retrieved from CRFReporter Simple xml.
Tips: write nonsense values (for easy UID recover) for 1990 only, export simple xml and find the nonsense
values in the xml. This guides close to the UIDs needed.

HWP Activity data
---------------

The years starting from 1961 miss the current inventory year. It is not automatically added.
The current inventory year must be manually inserted.
