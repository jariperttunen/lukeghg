This directory contains two tempalate excel files for 
GHG scenarios. The python program is ghgscenario.py.
For instructions see InstallAndUpdateLukeGHG.

+ ScenarioTemplate.xlsx: Defines the template Excel sheet for output.
   One sheet will be created for each land use and land use change class.
+ UIDMatrix.xlsx: Obsolete. Now part of ScenarioTemplate.xlsx.

The idea is to use ScenarioTemplate.xlsx to identify time series
from the scenario files and insert them to their proper places in their respective sheets
in the resulting scenarion Excel file. Also summary excel sheets will be generated.
